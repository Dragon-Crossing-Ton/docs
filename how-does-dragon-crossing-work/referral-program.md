# Referral Program

Dragon Crossing offers a multi-tiered referral program, allowing players to earn points by expanding the gameâ€™s community. The program is designed to incentivize players at different levels of the referral chain:

* **F0 (Direct Referrals)**: Players earn **5,000 points** for each friend they directly refer to the game.
* **F1, F2, F3 (Indirect Referrals)**: For each additional tier of referrals, players at F0 receive:
  * **20% of F1's referrals**
  * **10% of F2's referrals**
  * **5% of F3's referrals**

This cascading referral structure ensures ongoing rewards for players who actively promote the game, creating a win-win scenario for both the player and the community.
