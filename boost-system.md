# Boost System

To amplify the player experience, Dragon Crossing offers a **Boost System** that multiplies points earned during gameplay, significantly enhancing rewards:

* **Boost Power**: Each boost multiplies points by **4x** per session, creating a powerful incentive for players seeking rapid progression.
* **Boost Duration**: A single boost can be purchased for **100 Stars** and remains active for **one week**.
* **Renewal**: Once a boost expires, players must purchase another to continue receiving enhanced rewards.

This optional boost feature adds a layer of strategy, as players can decide when to invest in boosts for maximum impact.
