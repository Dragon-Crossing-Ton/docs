# Telegram Stars

**Telegram Stars** is a virtual currency used within the **Telegram ecosystem**. Stars allow users to purchase digital products and services in Telegram, such as e-books, online courses, or in-game items.

Users can buy Stars through in-app transactions via stores like the **Apple App Store** or **Google Play**, or via [**@PremiumBot**](https://t.me/PremiumBot) or other bots within Telegram.

Stars are bought and used exclusively within the Telegram ecosystem but are **not cryptocurrency** and cannot be purchased on cryptocurrency exchanges. However, developers or content creators can exchange the Stars they earn for **Toncoin** through the **Fragment** platform.
